        <p><b>Aim:</b>
            <br>A picture is worth a thousand words - and can be understood around the globe. With your help, we are creating a silhouette database. You will be shown black and white images, and you will need to rate each image. Your participation
            enables researchers and others interested to use standardized and representative
            research material.</p>

        <p><b>Payment:</b>
            <br>
            The task takes around 15-20 minutes.
            <span id="pay_info">
                <b>
                    We could not detect your Prolific ID!
                </b> Therefore we will assume that this is a voluntary testing and you will not receive payment. If you are trying to do this test as a job via Prolific and want to be
                compensated, you should open the proper link provided.
            </span>

        <p><b>Health Risks:</b>
            <br>Some of the images we are about to show you may be explicit and can depict violence or erotica. However, there are no known physical or psychological risks associated with participating in this study. </p>

        <p><b>Your Rights:</b>
            <br>You can stop participating in the study at any time without giving a reason (by closing or refreshing this website). In this case, all recorded data will be fully deleted. You can also skip answers during the test, if, for example,
            you
            were not sure what you saw on a given image. However, please do not skip too many; we reserve the right to refuse payment in case of a large amount of skipped images. If you would like to know the
            results of the study, please contact the
            experimenter
            (claudia.kawai@univie.ac.at).</p>

        <p><b>Anonymity and Privacy:</b>
            <br>The results of the study are used and published for research purposes. The data do not provide any information about you personally. You will not be named and your identity will be kept strictly confidential. Even after you have
            participated (until publication), you can prohibit the use of your data.</p>

        <p><b>Consent:</b>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        We will show you around 160 silhouettes in black and white, like, for example, the following:
        <br>
        <img id='example1_id' src="" alt="-- image 1 not loaded --">
        <img id='example2_id' src="" alt="-- image 2 not loaded --">
        <img id='example3_id' src="" alt="-- image 3 not loaded --">
        <br>
        Each silhouette will be presented for only a short period of time (2 seconds), so please pay close attention! After the 2 seconds have passed, the silhouette will be replaced with a rating scale. <br>
        <br>
        <span id="val_intro" style="display:none">Use the scale to rate the valence (positivity/negativity) of the image. Negative valence means that something is unpleasant or bad. Positive valence means that something is pleasant or good.
        </span>
        <span id="aro_intro" style="display:none">Use the scale to rate the arousal (low affective/high affective) of the image. Low arousal means that something is calm, tranquil or unexciting. High arousal means that something is intense,
            exciting or exhilarating.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        To give your rating on the scale, move the mouse cursor over the respective scale and click for the slider to appear. Now you can move the slider to the position that you think fits your evaluation best, via clicking or dragging. After
        selecting
        a value on each scale, the "Submit" button appears below. When you are satisfied with your
        choice, click the "Submit" button. Then the next image will appear, and so on. If you do not want to give a rating for an image, click "Continue without rating" and then
        "Submit".
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>You can give your ratings quickly and intuitively. Do not overthink it!</b>
